Poached Bananas

5 ripe bananas
1 cup rum
1/2 tsp ground clove
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 1/2 tbsp butter
1 tbsp white granulated sugar

Take the 5 bananas and cut them into med size chunks 2-3 inches long. Place them into a sauce pan with rum, butter, clove, and cinnamon. Set on medium heat and cover, stirring occasionally. Cook until bananas have become very soft (25-30 mins). Add water if poaching liquid gets low.
Pour through a fine mesh strainer to pull out bananas placing liquid back on the heat to reduce. Use a potato masher to mash bananas into a mostly smooth mixture. Place mashed banana back into fine mesh and strain extra liquid into the sauce pan to reduce with other remaining liquid.
Reduce liquid to approximately 1/4 cup.
