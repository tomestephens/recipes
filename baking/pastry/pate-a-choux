Principal ingredients:
5 tbsp butter
1/2 cup water (or milk, or 50/50)
1/2 tsp salt
3 tsp sugar
1/4 cup flour
4 eggs

Cook butter, water, salt and sugar in a saucepan over low heat. When the butter melts, bring the mixture to a boil; remove from the heat immediately. Tip the flour into the hot liquid. Stir with a wooden spoon until a firm, smooth paste forms. Return the saucepan to low heat to dry out the paste; continue beating until it forms a ball and pulls away cleanly from the sides of the saucepan.

Transfer the paste to a bowl; cool for 5 minutes. One by one, add 3 eggs to the paste, beating vigorously after each addition to incorporate as much air as possible. The paste should be smooth and shiny.

The paste is ready to be used, when it falls from the  spoon in a point. If it doesnâ€™t, add half of another beaten egg. Depending on the egg size and/or flour quality it may be necessary to use all of the egg
